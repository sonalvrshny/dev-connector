Mongo 
- Atlas is the cloud storage for Mongo - easier than locally stored database
- Since we are using Heroku to deploy, it is easier to just connect the cloud
- After logging in, create a project and in that have to create a cluster
- Once the cluster is created, add user and IP address (add your current)
- Connect to the db - Connect your application - will get connection details which is used in express
- mongoose is a package with npm - allows to model data
